# ⚛️ React Mastery Path

This repository documents my journey from a React Novice to a Master. It follows a structured, level-by-level progression, with each challenge introducing a core concept of modern React development.

**Built with:** React, Vite, CSS Modules, React Router, Context API.

## 🗺️ The Journey

The project is divided into four phases of difficulty.

### 🟢 Phase 1: The Novice (Foundations)
*Focus: Components, Props, State, and Lists.*

| Level | Challenge | Concept Learned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | The Hero Card | Components & Props Reusability |
| **02** | The Spoiler Button | `useState` (Booleans) & Conditional Rendering |
| **03** | Scoreboard | State Management (Numbers) |
| **04** | The Mirror | Controlled Inputs & Forms |
| **05** | The Playlist | Rendering Lists with `.map()` and Keys |
| **BOSS** | **RPG Inventory** | **CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Delete) in Arrays** |

### 🟡 Phase 2: The Apprentice (Side Effects)
*Focus: `useEffect`, APIs, and Lifecycle.*

| Level | Challenge | Concept Learned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **06** | The Watchman | Data Fetching (`fetch`) & Loading States |
| **07** | Dependency Array | Synchronizing State with Server Data |
| **08** | The Clock | Component Lifecycle & Cleanup (Unmounting) |
| **BOSS** | **Crypto Ticker** | **Real-time Data Fetching & Dynamic URLs** |

### 🟠 Phase 3: The Journeyman (Architecture)
*Focus: Global State and Routing.*

| Level | Challenge | Concept Learned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **09** | Theme Switcher | `useContext` & Global State |
| **10** | The Navigator | Client-Side Routing (SPA) with `react-router-dom` |
| **BOSS** | **Mini E-Commerce** | **Combining Context + Router for Persistent Data** |

### 🔴 Phase 4: The Master (Performance & Logic)
*Focus: Optimization and Advanced Hooks.*

| Level | Challenge | Concept Learned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11** | Laser Pointer | `useRef` for DOM Manipulation |
| **12** | Custom Hooks | Abstracting Logic (`useFetch`) |
| **13** | The Optimizer | Performance Tuning with `useMemo` |
| **BOSS** | **Kanban Board** | **Complex State, LocalStorage Persistence & Architecture** |

## ⚔️ The Arena (Practice Projects)
After completing the mastery path, I am now building standalone components from scratch to test my engineering skills without guidance.

* **Arena 1:** Product Review System (Forms & List Logic)
* *(More coming soon...)*

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
Through this project, I have learned to:
* Think in **Components**: Breaking complex UIs into small, reusable pieces.
* Manage **State**: Understanding when to use Local State vs. Global Context.
* Handle **Side Effects**: Fetching data and cleaning up timers properly.
* Optimize **Performance**: Using Memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
* Architect **Scalable Apps**: Organizing code with Custom Hooks and clean folder structures.
